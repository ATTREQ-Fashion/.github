## About

With our state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, we make sure you look and feel your best every day, without the hassle of deciding what to wear.

Simply input your wardrobe into our app and let our algorithm do the rest. It analyses your clothing choices, your style preferences, and the current weather, and suggests an outfit that is perfectly tailored to your needs.

With Attreq, you can save time and reduce stress by planning your outfit the night before, or quickly check what to wear as youâ€™re getting ready in the morning. Plus, our app is constantly learning and adapting to your style, so the more you use it, the more accurate and personalized your outfit suggestions become.
